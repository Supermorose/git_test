This is a test run of updating my GitHub repository through the command line on Linux. The date is November 29th, 2022. It is 12:15 P.M. and it is a Tuesday. I am currently feeling anxious about the uncertain future that lies ahead of me while I search for employment.
I am also feeling nervous about how my life will change once my child is born. My wife is currently three months pregnant and I am afraid that I will be incapable of providing what they will both need from me.
Still, I am doing my best on this journey because I owe it not only to myself but to my future family.
